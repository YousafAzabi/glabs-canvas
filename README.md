## Aims

### Primary

* To upskill on technologies and approaches we think will benefit our startups
* Increase our familiarity with the range and capabilities of comoditised tools available for zero cost
* Share all of our output as CC-zero blog posts or MIT open source projects for the benefit of our community
* We want this to be tool for honing our own best practice as an engineering team

### Secondary

* Hopefully create something that we might use with the startups

### Non-Aims

We will pretend to be a statup and eat our own dogfood, but not to the extent
that we will prioritise income over achieving our primary and secondary aims
(which is what we'd expect a real startup to do).

## Deliverables

In order to achieve these aims we will aim to address the following, mimicing what a real startup would face:

* MVP - build a collaborative customer value proposition canvas using Jison, D3 and some real-time sync technologoes
* create a marketing site to tell people about the product
* track user behaviour
* allow for people to pay for the product (at cost price)
* allow people who have paid access to a private canvas
* publish an iOS and Android app

## Approach

* Only time spent pair-programming can be billed to the canvas.in ticket, otherwise it is general upskilling. Let's pair program more!
* Planning meeting at the start of the week
* Work on one ticket and tell someone when it is done
* Retro at the end of the week
* Fork and pull requests for everything, no commits to master please
* James is taking responsibility for the project's success
